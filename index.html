                                <p>Began the TrueCrypt API project. The goal is to create an extensibility layer in form of a dynamic-link library. This apparently will require some heavy refactoring of the TrueCrypt code which although undesirable in a project like this, is unavoidable.</p>

                        <h2>Current projects</h2>
                        <p>Since the beginning of the year 2013, when my ways parted with my previous employment place, I've got at my displosal a very decent amount of time to spend with the things I love.
                            Software development has long been one of such things to me. So, while I studied a number of technologies new and refreshed my memories of the older ones,
                            I commenced a number of projects, some of which I am still working on. Here are these projects. If you wish to check out my previous activities, <a href="#resume">please see the Résumé</a>.</p>

                                    to solve a number of cryptography-related problems. I'm interested, so I've joined and currently working on first set of problems. The problems are interesting and blaze a trail to an area of expertise I was not very much acquainted with before. I do these on C so they also make a great exersise of my C skills.</p>
                                <p>Since Matasano asks not to disclose problem sets or solutions, there is no public repository to check out the code, sorry.</p>

                        <h1>About me</h1>
                        <p>At various stages of my life my personal interests turned to technology, sociology, phylosophy, linguistics, economics, geopolitics, literature, visual arts, history and some other stuff.</p>
                        <p>Professionally I've been mostly engaged in software development which I consider a true art form in itself. Indeed, not only it is a way to express oneself but also an inherently creative activity similar in its ways and feel to many art forms historically recognized as such.
                            My career begun in the ranks of junior developers in late nineties, so by present day I was able to immerse myself in roles of senior developer, project manager, CTO, product manager, CEO and enterpreneur.
                            Although I greatly enjoed the outlook from each of these standpoints, at present I find myself most passionately inclined towards low-level peculiarities of software systems, performance optimization and such.</p>
